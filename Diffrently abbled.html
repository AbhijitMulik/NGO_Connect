            At Adharwad Elder Care Center, our primary goal is to offer both permanent and temporary residential accommodation to elderly men and women in need. Additionally, we extend counseling services to women facing distressing circumstances, aiming to enhance their dignity and promote independence. Our dedication to fostering a sense of liberty is reflected in the comfortable living spaces we provide, emphasizing the importance of autonomy for our beneficiaries.
